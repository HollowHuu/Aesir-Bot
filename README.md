# Lunar Discord Bot
## Getting Started

First you need to set up your `.env`
```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_TOKEN
GUILD_ID=YOUR_GUILD_ID
API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```
The discord token can be found at [Discord's developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). You will have to make an application and get a bot token.

The API key is not available at the moment (therefore making this bot useless).
It will come in the future
