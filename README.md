# Lunar Discord Bot
## Getting Started

### Installation
#### Node.js
You will need to do a couple things to run the bot.
First navigate to [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and download the latest LTS version.
You can leave most options as is, but when it asks to download necessary tools, make sure to check the box.
It will start the installation of the required tools used to host the bot. Once finished you should be able to open a cmd and type `node -v`, 
it should show a version number that looks like "18.17.x". If it doesn't then you didn't do it right.

#### Project setup
From the github repo press `Code`, then `Download ZIP`. You will get a ZIP folder that you will have to extract (doesn't matter where).
Open that and in that folder run a CMD process.

First you need to set up your `.env`
```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_TOKEN
API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```
